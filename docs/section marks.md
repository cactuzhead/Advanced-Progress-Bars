## Section Mark Settings
### Section Marks
![Toggle](/assets/Obsidian Advanced Progress Bars - Settings - Toggle.png)

If this is toggled `on`, the progress bar will have equally spaced vertical markers along its length.
The number of marks will depend on the settings below.

### Automatically Assigned Marks
If this is toggled `on`, the progress bar will automaticlaly have equally spaced vertical markers along its length.

The following table shows how many marks will be displayed depending on the number of colors you have in the template.  **Note**, the demo progress bar in the settings uses the `default` template.

| Number of Colors | Number of Marks |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| 1                | 0               |
| 2                | 1               |
| 3                | 2               |
| 4                | 3               |
| 5                | 4               |

{: .note }
If your progress bar has only 1 color, you will by default, not see any markers.

However, if you want to manually overide this behavior to choose the number of equally spaced marks along **all** your progress bars then, toggle this setting `off`.

If you do so, a new `Number of marks` slider will apear underneath to allow you to set the number of marks you wish to be used for **all** of your progress bars.

This manual option ensures **all** your progress bars look similar, despite using different templates with varying numbers of colors.

### Number of Marks
If you have the `Automatically Assigned Marks` toggle in the `off` position (as described above), you can use this slider to pick exactly how many vertical marks you want evenly distributed along your progress bar.

{: .note }
This overrides the automatically assigned system, and applys to **all** your progress bars regardless of which template you use for each.

### Section Mark Color
This setting defines the color of the vertical section markers.

Use the colorpicker to select a custom color or alternatively, use one of the `Light` or `Dark` defaults by pressing the appropriate buttons.

{: .note }
The color selected will automatically be set to 50% transparency, allowing the progress bar's color to blend and influence the final appearance.

### Section Mark Width
This is a slider to set the width of each marker from a range of 1 to 5 pixels.
Pressing the `Reset to Default` button changes this value back to 3 pixels wide.
