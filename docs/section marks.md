## Section Mark Settings
### Section Marks
![Toggle](/assets/Obsidian Advanced Progress Bars - Settings - Toggle.png)

If this is toggled `on`, the progress bar will automaticlaly have equally spaced vertical markers along its length.
The following table shows how many marks will be displayed depending on the `Number of Colors` setting (located further down on the settings page).

| Number of Colors | Number of Marks |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| 1                | 0               |
| 2                | 1               |
| 3                | 2               |
| 4                | 3               |
| 5                | 4               |

{: .note }
If you have 1 color selected, you will by default, not see any markers.

### Automatically Assigned Marks
If this is toggled `on`, the progress bar will automaticlaly have equally spaced vertical markers along its length - as described above.

However, if you want to manually overide this behavior to choose the number of equally spaced marks along the progress bar then, toggle this setting `off`.

If you do so, a new slider will apear underneath to allow you to set the number of marks you wish to be used.

### Number of Marks
If you have the `Automatically Assigned Marks` toggle in the `off` position (as described above), you can use this slider to pick exactly how many vertical marks you want evenly distributed along your progress bar.

{: .note }
This overrides the automatically assigned system

### Section Mark Color
This setting defines the color of the vertical section markers.

Use the colorpicker to select a custom color or alternatively, use one of the `Light` or `Dark` defaults by pressing the appropriate buttons.

{: .note }
The color selected will automatically be set to 50% transparency, allowing the progress bar's color to blend and influence the final appearance.

### Section Mark Width
This is a slider to set the width of each marker from a range of 1 to 5 pixels.
Pressing the `Reset to Default` button changes this value back to 3 pixels wide.
