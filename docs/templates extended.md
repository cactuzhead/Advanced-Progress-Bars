## Templates Extended <span class="label label-green badge">NEW v1.1.4</span>
Starting in release `1.1.4`, you now have the additional ability to have per template color settings for the container, text, sub task text and progress bar.

This update removed a lot of the default color settings from the main settings and moved them to the default template.

For information about the original template system settings created before this update, please visit our `Templates` page.


## Edit Extended Colors
You should see a small change to the the existing template system.

Now, the default template and all custom templates should have a small settings button to the right of their template name.

![Button](/assets/Obsidian Advanced Progress Bars - Templates Extended Button.png)

This button once clicked will expand to show you 10 additional color settings for greater versatility of your Advanced Progress Bars.

The default template when expanded, will be highlighted by a green border around the new extended settings panel as well as the settings button itself.

You can open and close this panel at any time by pressing this button.

All custom templates will be differentiated from the default settings by using a blue border to highlight their settings instead of the default's green.

The panel will stay open (visible) until you either close it or you view another templates extended panel.  This was done so you don't get confused about which template the panel belongs to.

## Colors
Each color setting within this extended panel has a light and dark button so that you can set it to a default light or dark color.

However as always, you can use the color picker to set it to any color you desire for your default and custom templates.

## Transfer previous default colors
At the bottom of the `default` extended settings panel is an additional button which will transfer all of your previous colors to the default template.

You should only need to use this once, however, if in the future you change your defaults you can use this again to return to your original v1.1.3 default colors.

## Turning off & on
Instead of using a toggle to turn on or off a particular setting as was previously done prior to v1.1.4 you can simply set your color to pure black `#000000` this will tell APB to not display this particular setting (or make it invisible).

The *only* setting that you can not switch off or make transparent is the `Bar background color` as it is required to be a color for the progress bar to work correctly.

This is why it the only color setting that allows you to use pure black `#000000`.
