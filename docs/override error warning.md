## Override Error Warning
Typically, when your `Value` exceeds the `Total`, this error will appear to help you identify and correct any mistakes while editing the Value.

However, there may be instances where you would prefer the ability to exceed 100%, and this is where this setting proves useful.

When you toggle `on` the `Override large value error`, **APB** will no longer display an error if the Value exceeds the Total.

Additionally, a second setting will appear, allowing you to customize the color of the percentage text once it exceeds 100%.

As usual, there are two defaults `Light` and `Dark` or select a custom color using the colorpicker.

As shown in the image above, the percentage text changes color and now displays values exceeding 100%.
