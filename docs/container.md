## Container Settings

{: .removed }
These color settings were removed in version 1.1.4 as most of the colors are now handled with the expanded template system.  The `Top Margin` setting remains.

Similar to the text settings, this section includes two pairs of options for customizing the Border and Background of the container.

- use the toggles to turn them `on` or `off`
- use the color picker to set a custom color
- or use the `Light` and `Dark` color defaults

### Top Margin <span class="label label-grey badge">NEW v1.1.2</span>
When this is toggled `on`, the progress bar will have a larger margin at the top to avoid text being obscured by the `</>` in the top right of the code block when you mouse over.

If it is turned off then it behaves as before to save vertical screen space for those who don't mind the hover over </> obscuring the top right text.

{: .note }
This extra spacing only happens once for each code block, so if you have multiple progress bars in one code block the spacing between progress bars will remain the same.
