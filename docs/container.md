## Container Settings
Similar to the text settings above, this section includes two pairs of options for customizing the Border and Background of the container.

- use the toggles to turn them `on` or `off`
- use the color picker to set a custom color
- or use the `Light` and `Dark` color defaults

### Top Margin <span class="label label-green badge">NEW v1.1.2</span>
When this is toggled `on`, the progress bar will have a larger margin at the top to avoid text being obscured by the `</>` in the top right of the code block when you mouse over.

![Hotkey](/assets/Obsidian Advanced Progress Bars - Manual Refresh Hotkey.png)

If it is turned off then it behaves as before to save vertical screen space for those who don't mind the hover over </> obscuring the top right text.
