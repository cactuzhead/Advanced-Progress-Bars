## Progress Bar Color Settings
Here, you will find all the available color options for customizing the progress bar.

### Completed Color
This color is what the progress bar will be when it has reached 100%.
You can see in the image above, that the bottom completed progress bar is using the default `Dark` option which is a light blue-grey color.

### Bar Background Color
This is the color for the remaining portion of the progress bar.
In this example it is a mid blue-grey color.
