# Box-Shadow <span class="label label-green badge">NEW v1.1.0</span>
Starting in release `1.1.0`, You can now add a box shadow to your progress bars.

Toggling the box-shadow `on` will reveal a further 4 options:-

## Box-Shadow Type
If this is toggled `off` you will have a glow shadow that shows around your progress bars container.

When you toggle this `on` you will be selecting a drop shadow and will additionally add two further settings.

These two `H-Offset` and `V-Offset` sliders will allow you to set the horizontal and vertical offsets from a range of 1 to 5 pixels.

{: .note }
The glow shadow option (obtained by toggling this `off`) is effectively setting both of these offsets to zero and is a quicker and simpler way to setup a glow shadow.

## Blur
Define the blur of the drop-shadow from a range of 0 to 5 pixels.  Zero is no blur whilst five gives a nice subtle blur.

## Inset
When this is toggled `on` you invert the box-shadow so that it runs from the border of your progress bars container inwards rather than the more usual outwards.

## Box-Shadow Color
Select your desired custom color for the box-shadow with the colorpicker or use one of the `Light` or `Dark` defaults.
