# Changelog

## Release v1.0.8
1. Added removal of the list bullets, to the left of progress bars, within columns on a Dashboard++ page, enhancing visual clarity.

## Release v1.0.7
1. Added a new toggle in the Progress Bar Color section called `Gradient Type`. This setting allows you to select either a color-mixed linear gradient or a simple linear gradient for your gradients.
2. Added a new section called `Tasks` with 6 settings.
This will allow you to track the completion of tasks (and sub tasks) and for these to be reflected automatically in your progress bar.
This is done by using tags, please see the full documentation for a detailed explanation of what this is, what the settings do and how to add tags.

## Release v1.0.6
1. Added an `Override large value error toggle` with accompanying percentage text color options.
With this set, APB will no longer show an error when the Value exceeds the Total. Instead, it will display the percentage text in a new color and now supports values exceeding 100%.
