## Light & Dark Settings <span class="label label-grey badge">REMOVED v1.1.4</span>

{: .removed }
This setting was removed in version 1.1.4 as most of the colors are now handled with the expanded template system.

![Light and Dark](/assets/Obsidian Advanced Progress Bars - Settings - Light and Dark.png)

These two buttons (`Light` & `Dark`) will change **ALL** the color settings to their respective defaults.
All templates and other settings will remain unchanged.

{: .note }
Once selected, all previous colors will be lost forever and can **not** be retrieved.
