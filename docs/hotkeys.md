## Hotkeys
There are two hotkeys you can setup with Advance Progress Bars.
- Paste code block
- Task manual refresh

## Paste Code Block Hotkey Setup
To make it more convenient, you can add a hotkey that automatically inserts a progress bar code block into Obsidian. Simply follow these steps:

1. Open Obsidian and go to the **Settings** by clicking the gear icon in the bottom left corner.
2. From the **Settings** menu, go to the **Hotkeys** section on the left sidebar.
3. In the filter search bar found at the top of the Hotkeys section, start typing **"Advanced Progress Bars"** to find the `Advanced Progress Bars: Paste code block` action.
