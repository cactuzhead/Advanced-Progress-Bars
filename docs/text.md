## Text Settings
There are four pairs of settings which relate to `Title`, `Percentage`, `Fraction` (value/total) and `Completed Text`.

If you toggle each text item `on`, it will display that particular text on your progress bar (see image above).

The `completed` text will be displayed over the top of the progress bar, and will only be shown when it reaches 100%.

![Completed](/assets/Obsidian Advanced Progress Bars - Settings - Completed.png)

(as always, you can see what it will look like by viewing the demo progress bar near the top of the settings.).

Using the accompanying color settings will allow you to pick your desired custom color for each of the four text items.

Alternatively, you could use one of the `Light` or `Dark` defaults by pressing the appropriate buttons.
