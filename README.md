# Obsidian Settings
## Usage Example Code Block
To insert an `Advanced Progress Bar` into `Obsidian`, you use a fenced code block similar to the one below.
````
```obsidian-apb
My Title: 57/100
```
````
In the `obsidian-apb` code block, you define the attributes as `Title`: `Value` / `Total`.

Note: the text within the code block example on the settings page will automatically be updated to reflect the changes you make in the other settings.

### Hotkey Setup
To make it more convenient, you can add a hotkey that automatically inserts a progress bar code block into Obsidian. Simply follow these steps:

1. **Open Obsidian** and go to the **Settings** by clicking the gear icon in the bottom left corner.
2. From the **Settings** menu, go to the **Hotkeys** section on the left sidebar.
3. In the filter search bar found at the top of the Hotkeys section, start typing **"Advanced Progress Bars"** to find the **"Advance Progress Bars: Paste Code Block"** action.

4. Click on the round plus button next to the found action, and assign the desired hotkey combination (e.g., `Ctrl + Shift + B` or any other combo that suits you).
5.

### Copy to Clipboard
Instead of manually typing the code block, or setting up a hotkey,  you can use the `Copy to Clipboard` button, found at the top of the settings page to quickly copy it for later pasting into Obsidian.

### Multiple Advanced Progress Bars
You can also stack progress bars by adding additional bars within the same code block, see example below.
````
```obsidian-apb
My Title: 57/100
Smaller Total: 2/7
Very Large Total: 2034/2345
```
````
The above stacked bars example would be rendered like this (using default dark colors & settings)

Note: The code block example on the settings page will only include one progress bar. You will need to manually add any additional progress bars once pasted into Obsidian.
